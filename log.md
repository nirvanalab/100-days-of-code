# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 28,2018

**Project** : Jagadam (Unity)

**Today's Progress**: Added bullet and reticle functionality for each gun.

**Thoughts:** Adding bullet functionality was easy. Struggled with including the canvas & image and resizing the components to place in front of the gun.

### Day 2: May 29,2018

**Project** : Jagadam (Unity)

**Today's Progress**: Added ammunition logic for the guns and added enemy robots with corresponding animation.

### Day 3: May 30,2018

**Project** : Jagadam (Unity)

**Today's Progress**: Added enemy weapon logic and initial game play logic.

### Day 4: May 31,2018

**Project** : Jagadam (Unity)

**Today's Progress**: Added more game play logic. Trying to handle the logic where bullets affect enemys health
