# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 28,2018

**Project** : Jagadam (Unity)

**Today's Progress**: Added bullet and reticle functionality for each gun.

**Thoughts:** Adding bullet functionality was easy. Struggled with including the canvas & image and resizing the components to place in front of the gun.
