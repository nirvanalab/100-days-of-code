# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 28,2018

**Project** : Jagadam (Unity)

**Today's Progress**: Added bullet and reticle functionality for each gun.

**Thoughts:** Adding bullet functionality was easy. Struggled with including the canvas & image and resizing the components to place in front of the gun.

### Day 2: May 29,2018

**Project** : Jagadam (Unity)

**Today's Progress**: Added ammunition logic for the guns and added enemy robots with corresponding animation.

**Thoughts:** : Pretty straightforward. The navmesh agent for the player didn't work as expected. Had to pass in OVRCameraRig instead of Player GameObject.

### Day 3: May 30,2018

**Project** : Jagadam (Unity)

**Today's Progress**: Added enemy weapon logic and initial game play logic.

**Thoughts:** : Couldn't figure out the enemy animation when weapon fires yet. Initial game play logic for now only affects the player health.

### Day 4: May 31,2018

**Project** : Jagadam (Unity)

**Today's Progress**: Added more game play logic. Trying to handle the logic where bullets affect enemys health

**Thoughts:** : There are misc bugs, for example the bullets are not appearing properly. The enemy missiles are not shooting as expected. Need to work on it a bit more

### Day 5: June 1,2018

**Project** : Jagadam (Unity)

**Today's Progress**: Started work on the ammo and  health pickup UI annd logic

**Thoughts:** : Encountering issues related to trigger collider. Trying to figure out how to handle the player andd ammo health trigger collission
